# IBM-SGUnited Mid-Career Pathways Programme-Company Training: Final Project (Artificial Intelligence Practitioner)

To improve quality of support and enhance customer’s experience by implementing a readily-available AI solution for local printing company, Expressprint.

The company, Expressprint is currently facing challenges in replying its customer’s inquiries promptly after working hours and also during the high demand period during the office hours. These problem have negatively impacted on customer service quality as well as have resulted in a loss of revenue for the company. 

So, customers end up feeling overwhelmed by the amount of printing industry related jargon & ordering process, as well as frustrated due to the lack of timely support.

Thus, we created a chatbot prototype using IBM's Watson Assistant and Watson Discovery Service to resolve the problems faced by Expressprint
